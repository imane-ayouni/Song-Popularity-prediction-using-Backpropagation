# Song-Popularity-prediction-using-Backpropagation
A simple neural net to predict song popularity based on its features


# Topic
Humans have greatly associated themselves with Songs & Music. It can improve mood, decrease pain and anxiety, and facilitate opportunities for emotional expression. Research suggests that music can benefit our physical and mental health in numerous ways.
Lately, multiple studies have been carried out to understand songs & it's popularity based on certain factors. Such song samples are broken down & their parameters are recorded to tabulate. Predicting the Song Popularity is the main aim.
The project is simple yet challenging, to predict the song popularity based on energy, acoustics, instumentalness, liveness, dancibility, etc.
In this notebook I will attempt to build a neural network that can predict the popularity of a song based on its features. It is a regression problem and I have a continuous value for a target.
